# Build My World

This is the first project that I built for my Udacity Robotic Software Engineer program.  This project contains a simulation environment built in Gazebo.  It contains a building created with the Gazebo building editor, and a model made with the Gazebo model editor.  It also contains a simple C++ plugin that displays text to the screen when the environment is launched.
